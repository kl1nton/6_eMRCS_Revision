Please select the most likely explanation for the following patients with parotid gland symptoms. Each option may be used once, more than once or not at all.

### Q1
A 50 year old female presents with bilateral parotid gland swelling and symptoms of a dry mouth. On examination she has bilateral facial nerve palsies. This improved following steroid treatment.

#### Answer: C. Sarcoid - TRUE
- Theme from April 2013
- Sarcoid occurs bilaterally in 70% of cases and facial nerve involvement is recognised
- Treatment is conservative in most cases although individuals with facial nerve palsy will usually receive steroids with good effect

### Q2
A 50 year old women presents with a diffuse swelling in the region of her right parotid together with facial pain. On examination she has a right sided facial nerve palsy.

#### Answer: B. Adenoid cystic carcinoma - TRUE
- Adenoid cystic carcinoma commonly infiltrates the facial nerve and may cause neuropathy and facial pain

### Q3
A 50 year old lady presents with symptoms of a dry mouth that has been present for the past few months. She also has a sensation of grittiness in her eyes. On examination she has a diffuse swelling of her parotid gland. There is no evidence of facial nerve palsy.

#### Answer - D: Sjogrens syndrome - TRUE
- Theme from April 2014 exam
- Most patients with Sjogrens present in the post menopausal years. Multi system involvement is common

### Q4
A 34 year old lady presents with a long standing offensive discharge from the ear and on examination is noted to have a reduction in her hearing of 40 decibels compared to the opposite side.

#### Answer: F. Long standing perforation of the pars tensa - *FALSE* = E. Cholesteatoma - TRUE
- *Theme from January 2013 Exam*
- Combination of offensive discharge + hearing loss is strongly suggestive of cholesteatoma

### Q5
A 4 year old is brought to the general practitioner by her mother. She has been distressed with ear pain for the past 14 hours. She is constantly touching and pulling at her ear. Whilst she is sat in the waiting room her mother notices a discharge of foul smelling fluid from the ear, following which the pain resolves.

#### Answer: E. Cholesteatoma - *FALSE* = D. Acute suppurative otitis media - TRUE
- In young children acute suppurative otitis media is a common condition
- Rupture of the tympanic membrane is a **rare**, but recognised complication

### Q6
A 4 year old child is brought to the clinic by his father. They are concerned because the child has been noted to have a small epithelial defect anterior to the left ear and is has been noted to discharge foul smelling material for the past 2 days.

#### Answer: C. Preauricular sinus - TRUE
- Pre auricular sinuses that a deeper may accumulate secretions and produce foul smelling discharge

Disorders affecting the ear


Otitis externa
Variant	Cause	Features	Treatment
Acute otitis externa	Boil in external auditory meatus	Acute pain on moving the pinna
Conductive hearing loss if lesion is large
When rupture occurs pus will flow from ear	Ear packs may be used
Topical antibiotics
Operative debridement may be needed in severe cases
Chronic otitis externa	Chronic combined infection in the external auditory meatus usually combined staphylococcal and fungal infection	Chronic discharge from affected ear, hearing loss and severe pain rare	Cleansing of the external ear and treatment with antifungal and antibacterial ear drops

Otitis media
Variant	Cause	Features	Treatment
Acute suppurative otitis media	Viral induced middle ear effusions secondary to eustacian tube dysfunction	Most common in children and rare in adults
May present with symptoms elsewhere (e.g. vomiting) in children
Severe pain and sometimes fever
May present with discharge is tympanic rupture occurs	Antibiotics (usually amoxycillin)
Chronic suppurative otitis media	May occur with or without cholesteatoma 
Those without cholesteatoma have a perforation of the pars tensa 
Those with cholesteatoma have a perforation of the pars flaccida	Those without cholesteatoma may complain of intermittent discharge (non offensive)
Those with cholesteatoma have impaired hearing and foul smelling discharge	Simple pars tensa perforations may be managed non operatively or a myringoplasty considered if symptoms troublesome.
Pars flaccida perforations will usually require a radical mastoidectomy

Otosclerosis
Progressive conductive deafness
Secondary to fixation of the stapes in the oval window
Treatment is with stapedectomy and insertion of a prosthesis

Acoustic neuroma
Symptoms of gradually progressive unilateral perceptive deafness and tinnitus
Involvement of the vestibular nerve may cause vertigo
Extension to involve the facial nerve may cause weakness and then paralysis.

Pre auricular sinus
Common congenital condition in which an epithelial defect forms around the external ear
Small sinuses require no treatment
Deeper sinuses may become blocked and develop episodes of infection, they may be closely related to the facial nerve and are challenging to excise

## Q7
A 46-year-old woman is referred to endocrine surgery for a possible thyroidectomy. She has a tender neck swelling. Blood results are as follows:

TSH	<0.1 mU/l
T4	188 nmol/l
 
Hb	14.2 g/dl
Plt	377 * 10^9/l
WBC	6.4 * 10^9/l
 
ESR	65 mm/hr

Technetium thyroid scan shows decreased uptake globally

What is the most likely diagnosis?

	A.	Sick thyroid syndrome
	B.	Acute bacterial thyroiditis
	C.	Hashimoto's thyroiditis
	D.	Subacute thyroiditis
	E.	Toxic multinodular goitre

#### Answer:  C. Hashimoto's thyroiditis - *FALSE* = D.	Subacute thyroiditis - TRUE
- This patient does not need surgery! 
	- Subacute thyroiditis is suggested by the tender goitre, hyperthyroidism and raised ESR
- The globally reduced uptake on technetium thyroid scan is also typical.
- This should resolve without any active intervention

Thyroiditis

Sub acute thyroiditis
Subacute thyroiditis (also known as De Quervain's thyroiditis) is thought to occur following viral infection and typically presents with hyperthyroidism

Features
Hyperthyroidism
Painful goitre
Raised ESR
Globally reduced uptake on iodine-131 scan

Management
Usually self-limiting - most patients do not require treatment
Thyroid pain may respond to aspirin or other NSAIDs
In more severe cases steroids are used, particularly if hypothyroidism develops

Hashimotos thyroiditis
Hashimotos thyroiditis is an immunological disorder in which lymphocytes become sensitised to thyroidal antigens. The three most important antibodies include; thyroglobulin, TPO and TSH-R. During the early phase of Hashimotos the the thyroglobulin antibody is markedly elevated and then declines. 

Features
Goitre and either euthyroid or mild hypothyroidism
Progressive hypothyroidism (and associated symptoms)

Management
During the hyperthyroid phase of illness beta blockers may manage symptoms
As hypothyroidism develops patients may require thyroxine

## Q8-10: Theme: Voice disorders

A.	Vagus nerve injury
B.	Thyroid nerve injury
C.	Superior laryngeal nerve injury
D.	Unilateral inferior laryngeal nerve injury
E.	Bilateral inferior laryngeal nerves injuries
F.	Stroke
G.	Lacunar infarcts
H.	None of the above

Please select the most likely reason for the scenarios given. Each option may be used once, more than once or not at all.

### Q8
A 42 year old singer is admitted for a thyroidectomy. Post operatively she is only able to make a gargling noise. Her voice sounds breathy.

#### Answer: D. Unilateral inferior laryngeal nerve injury - TRUE
- This patient has diplophonia which causes a gargling sound. This is associated with dysphagia
- This can also be caused by a vagus nerve lesion, but the recurrent laryngeal nerve is more at risk of damage.

### Q9
A 42 year old singer is admitted for a thyroidectomy. Post operatively she is unable to sing high pitched notes.

#### Answer: C. Superior laryngeal nerve injury - TRUE
- Theme from September 2011 Exam
- SLN lesions cause difficulty in voice pitch.

### Q10
A 42 year old singer is admitted for a thyroidectomy. Post operatively the patient develops dyspnoea and is unable to speak.

#### Answer: E. Bilateral inferior laryngeal nerves injuries - TRUE
- This patient has aphonia due to bilateral damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve.

Voice production


There are 2 main nerves involved:

Superior laryngeal nerve (SLN)
Innervates the cricothyroid muscle

Since the cricothyroid muscle is involved in adjusting the tension of the vocal fold for high notes during singing, SLN paresis and paralysis result in:

a. Abnormalities in pitch
b. Inability to sing with smooth change to each higher note (glissando or pitch glide)

Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN)/Inferior laryngeal nerve
Innervates intrinsic larynx muscles

a. Opening vocal folds (as in breathing, coughing)
b. Closing vocal folds for vocal fold vibration during voice use
c. Closing vocal folds during swallowing

## Q11-13: 
Theme: Nasal diseases

A.	Ethmoid sinus cancer
B.	Maxillary sinus cancer
C.	Ethmoid adenoma
D.	Maxillary adenoma
E.	Ethmoidal fracture
F.	Nasal polyps
G.	Sphenoid osteoma
H.	Ethmoidal sinusitis
I.	Maxillary sinusitis

Please select the most likely diagnosis for the scenario given. Each option may be used once, more than once or not at all.

### Q11
A 56 year old man presents with symptoms of nasal pain, anosmia and rhinorrhea. He has been well until recently and has worked as a wood carver for many years.

#### Answer: E. Ethmoidal fracture - TRUE
- *Theme from September 2012 Exam*, *Theme from September 2013 Exam*
- Nasopharyngeal cancer is strongly associated with wood work
- Most cases require an occupational exposure of greater than 10 years and are adenocarcinomas on histology
- Most cases are ethmoidal in origin (Hadfield E. Ann R Coll Surg Engl. 1970 June; 46(6): 301319)

### Q12
A 32 year old female presents with recurrent episodes of rhinorrhoea, the discharge is watery. She has a medical history of asthma and intolerance of aspirin. On examination she has multiple soft, semi-transparent polyps within her nasal cavity.

#### Answer: F. Nasal polyps - TRUE
- The combination of nasal polyps and atopy is well described
- Some cases will respond favourably to systemic steroids and avoid surgery

### Q13
A child is brought to casualty complaining of a headache and a sensation of pressure between the eyes. On examination she is febrile with a smooth swelling overlying the superomedial aspect of the right eye. The eye is uncomfortable and there is a purulent discharge from the inner canthus.

#### Answer: H. Ethmoidal sinusitis - TRUE
- Ethmoidal sinusitis may spread to the periorbital tissues resulting in periorbital cellulitis
- The superomedial distribution makes a maxillary sinusitis less likely

Diseases of nose and sinuses

Benign Tumours
Simple papillomas may be an incidental finding or present with obstructive symptoms. Excision under general anaesthesia is sufficient management.
Transitional cell papillomas may be more extensive and produce obstructive symptoms. Erosion of local structures is a recognised complication. These lesions may rarely undergo malignant transformation and therefore careful and complete excision is required, some cases may require partial or total maxillectomy.
Pleomorphic adenomas of the maxillary sinuses are reported but are extremely rare, their symptoms typically include nasal obstruction and pain if the sinus is obstructed. Treatment is by complete surgical excision, the diagnosis is not infrequently made post operatively.
Benign osteomas may develop in the paranasal sinuses, the frontal sinus is the most frequent location of such lesions. Symptoms include; pain, rhinorrhoea and anosmia. Most osteomas may be observed if asymptomatic, sphenoid osteomas should be resected soon after diagnosis as enlargement may compromise visual fields. Many sinus osteomas can now be resected endoscopically, complete surgical resection is required.
Nasal polyps are benign lesions of the ethmoid sinus mucosa. Many patients may also have asthma, cystic fibrosis and a sensitivity to aspirin. Symptoms include watery rhinorrhoea, infection and anosmia. The polyps are usually a semi transparent grey mass. They are rare in childhood. Treatment is either with systemic steroids or surgical resection. The latter should be combined with antral washout. Low dose, nasal, steroid drops may reduce the risk of recurrence.

Malignant disease
Malignancies encountered in the nose and paranasal sinuses include; adenoid cystic carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma.
Adenocarcinoma of the paranasal sinuses and nasopharynx is strongly linked to exposure to hard wood dust (after >10 years exposure).
Adenoid cystic carcinoma usually originate in the smaller salivary glands.
The majority of cancers (50%) arise from the lateral nasal wall, a smaller number (33%) arise from the maxillary antrum, ethmoid and sphenoid cancers comprise only 7%.
Signs of malignancy on clinical examination include loose teeth, cranial nerve palsies and lymphadenopathy.
Nasopharyngeal cancers are most common in individuals presenting from China and Asia and are linked to viral infection with Epstein Barr Virus. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are the most commonly used modalities.

Maxillary sinusitis
Common symptoms include post nasal discharge, pain, headache and toothache.
Imaging may show a fluid level in the antrum.
Common organisms include Haemophilus influenzae or Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Treatment with antral lavage may facilitate diagnosis and relieve symptoms. Antimicrobial therapy has to be continued for long periods. Antrostomy may be needed.

Frontoethmoidal sinusitis
Usually presents with frontal headache, nasal obstruction and altered sense of smell.
Inflammation may progress to involve periorbital tissues. Ocular symptoms may occur and secondary CNS involvement brought about by infection entering via emissary veins.
CT scanning is the imaging modality of choice. Early cases may be managed with antibiotics. More severe cases usually require surgical drainage.

## Q14
Which of the following statements relating to branchial cysts is _untrue_?

	A. The greater auricular nerve may be divided during excision
	B. They typically occur in young adults
	C. They move upwards on swallowing
	D. They are rare over the age of 40 years
	E. They are usually located in the anterior triangle of the neck

### Answer: E. They are usually located in the anterior triangle of the neck - TRUE
- Nerves at risk during branchial cyst excision
	1. Mandibular branch of facial nerve
	2. Greater auricular nerve
	3. accessory nerve

### Notes
- They do not move on swallowing
- They should be diagnosed with caution in those aged >40 years
	- Lumps in this age group may in fact be metastatic disease from ENT malignancy

## Q15
A 22 year old female attends clinic after noticing a painless neck lump. On examination she is noted to have bilateral thyroid masses and multicentric nodes near the base of the thyroid. Her corrected Ca is 2.18. What is the most likely diagnosis?

	A. Sporadic medullary carcinoma of the thyroid
	B. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia
	C. Follicular thyroid carcinoma
	D. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma
	E. Toxic nodular goitre

### Answer: E. Toxic nodular goitre - *FALSE* = B. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia = TRUE

- Medullary thyroid cancer is a tumour of the parafollicular cells of the thyroid
	- Less than 10% of thyroid cancers are of this type
	- Patients typically present in children or young adults
	- Diarrhoea occurs in 30% of cases
- Toxic nodular goitre are very rare
- In sporadic medullary thyroid cancer, patients typically present with a unilateral solitary nodule and it tends to spread early to the neck lymph nodes
- In association with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes
	- Medullary thyroid cancers are always bilateral and multicentric
- It may be the presenting feature in MEN 2a and 2b
	- Almost all MEN 2a patients develop medullary thyroid carcinoma

Thyroid malignancy

Papillary carcinoma
Commonest sub-type
Accurately diagnosed on fine needle aspiration cytology
Histologically they may demonstrate psammoma bodies (areas of calcification) and so called 'orphan Annie' nuclei
They typically metastasise via the lymphatics and thus laterally located apparently ectopic thyroid tissue is usually a metastasis from a well differentiated papillary carcinoma

Follicular carcinoma
Are less common than papillary lesions
Like papillary tumours, they may present as a discrete nodule. Although they appear to be well encapsulated macroscopically there is invasion on microscopic evaluation
Lymph node metastases are uncommon and these tumours tend to spread haematogenously. This translates into a higher mortality rate
Follicular lesions cannot be accurately diagnosed on fine needle aspiration cytology and thus all follicular FNA's (THY 3) will require at least a hemi thyroidectomy

Anaplastic carcinoma
Less common and tend to occur in elderly females
Disease is usually advanced at presentation and often only palliative decompression and radiotherapy can be offered.

Medullary carcinoma
These are tumours of the parafollicular cells ( C Cells) and are of neural crest origin.
The serum calcitonin may be elevated which is of use when monitoring for recurrence.
They may be familial and occur as part of the MEN -2A disease spectrum.
Spread may be either lymphatic or haematogenous and as these tumours are not derived primarily from thyroid cells they are not responsive to radioiodine.

Lymphoma
These respond well to radiotherapy
Radical surgery is unnecessary once the disease has been diagnosed on biopsy material. Such biopsy material is not generated by an FNA and thus a core biopsy has to be obtained (with care!).

## Q16-18
Theme: Parotid gland disorders

A.	Sialectasis
B.	Pleomorphic adenoma
C.	Bacterial parotitis
D.	Viral parotitis
E.	Sjogren's syndrome
F.	Adenoid cystic carcinoma
G.	Mucoepidermoid carcinoma
H.	Warthins tumour

Please select the most likely diagnosis for the scenario given. Each option may be used once, more than once or not at all.

### Q16
A 40 year old lady with longstanding rheumatoid arthritis presents with a dry mouth and parotid gland swelling. Her symptoms transiently improved following administration of a course of steroids for her rheumatoid disease.

#### E, Sjogren's syndrome - TRUE
- *Theme from April 2012 Exam*
- Sjogrens syndrome is linked to other autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid disease
- A transient improvement may be seen with steroid administration
- Most patients are treated with artificial saliva

### Q17
A 77 year old lady presents with facial pain and on examination is found to have clinical evidence of a facial nerve palsy and a parotid mass. Following surgical excision of the lesion the histological report comments on extensive perineural invasion.

#### B. Pleomorphic adenoma - *FALSE* = F. Adenoid cystic carcinoma - TRUE
- Extensive perineural invasion is most commonly seen in patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma
- Both Warthins tumours and mucoepidermoid carcinoma rarely show such marked perineural infiltration.

## Q18
An 18 year old boy presents with pancreatitis. He has bilateral painful parotid enlargement.

#### Answer: D. Viral parotitis - TRUE
- In a young adult with parotid swelling and pancreatitis/orchitis/reduced hearing/meningoencephalitis suspect mumps


Parotid gland clinical


Benign neoplasms
Up to 80% of all salivary gland tumours occur in the parotid gland and up to 80% of these are benign. There is no consistent correlation between the rate of growth and the malignant potential of the lesion. However, benign tumours should not invade structures such as the facial nerve. 
With the exception of Warthins tumours, they are commoner in women than men. The median age of developing a lesion is in the 5th decade of life. 

Benign tumour types
Tumour type	Features
Benign pleomorphic adenoma or benign mixed tumor	Most common parotid neoplasm (80%) 
Proliferation of epithelial and myoepithelial cells of the ducts and an increase in stromal components
Slow growing, lobular, and not well encapsulated
Recurrence rate of 1-5% with appropriate excision (parotidectomy)
Recurrence possibly secondary to capsular disruption during surgery
Malignant degeneration occurring in 2-10% of adenomas observed for long periods, with carcinoma ex-pleomorphic adenoma occurring most frequently as adenocarcinoma
Warthin tumor (papillary cystadenoma lymphoma or adenolymphoma	Second most common benign parotid tumor (5%)
Most common bilateral benign neoplasm of the parotid
Marked male as compared to female predominance
Occurs later in life (sixth and seventh decades)
Presents as a lymphocytic infiltrate and cystic epithelial proliferation
May represent heterotopic salivary gland epithelial tissue trapped within intraparotid lymph nodes
Incidence of bilaterality and multicentricity of 10%
Malignant transformation rare (almost unheard of)
Monomorphic adenoma	Account for less than 5% of tumours
Slow growing
Consist of only one morphological cell type (hence term mono)
Include; basal cell adenoma, canalicular adenoma, oncocytoma, myoepitheliomas
Haemangioma	Should be considered in the differential of a parotid mass in a child
Accounts for 90% of parotid tumours in children less than 1 year of age
Hypervascular on imaging
Spontaneous regression may occur and malignant transformation is almost unheard of

Malignant salivary gland tumours
Types of malignancy

Mucoepidermoid carcinoma	30% of all parotid malignancies
Usually low potential for local invasiveness and metastasis (depends mainly on grade)
Adenoid cystic carcinoma	Unpredictable growth pattern
Tendency for perineural spread
Nerve growth may display skip lesions resulting in incomplete excision
Distant metastasis more common (visceral rather than nodal spread)
5 year survival 35%
Mixed tumours	Often a malignancy occurring in a previously benign parotid lesion
Acinic cell carcinoma	Intermediate grade malignancy
May show perineural invasion
Low potential for distant metastasis
5 year survival 80%
Adenocarcinoma	Develops from secretory portion of gland
Risk of regional nodal and distant metastasis
5 year survival depends upon stage at presentation, may be up to 75% with small lesions with no nodal involvement
Lymphoma	Large rubbery lesion, may occur in association with Warthins tumours
Diagnosis should be based on regional nodal biopsy rather than parotid resection
Treatment is with chemotherapy (and radiotherapy)

Diagnostic evaluation
Plain x-rays may be used to exclude calculi
Sialography may be used to delineate ductal anatomy
FNAC is used in most cases
Superficial parotidectomy may be either diagnostic of therapeutic depending upon the nature of the lesion
Where malignancy is suspected the primary approach should be definitive resection rather than excisional biopsy
CT/ MRI may be used in cases of malignancy for staging primary disease

Treatment
For nearly all lesions this consists of surgical resection, for benign disease this will usually consist of a superficial parotidectomy. For malignant disease a radical or extended radical parotidectomy is performed. The facial nerve is included in the resection if involved. The need for neck dissection is determined by the potential for nodal involvement.

Other parotid disorders
HIV infection
Lymphoepithelial cysts associated with HIV occur almost exclusively in the parotid
Typically presents as bilateral, multicystic, symmetrical swelling
Risk of malignant transformation is low and management usually conservative

Sjogren syndrome
Autoimmune disorder characterised by parotid enlargement, xerostomia and keratoconjunctivitis sicca
90% of cases occur in females
Second most common connective tissue disorder
Bilateral, non tender enlargement of the gland is usual
Histologically, the usual findings are of a lymphocytic infiltrate in acinar units and epimyoepithelial islands surrounded by lymphoid stroma
Treatment is supportive
There is an increased risk of subsequent lymphoma

Sarcoid
Parotid involvement occurs in 6% of patients with sarcoid
Bilateral in most cases
Gland is not tender
Xerostomia may occur
Management of isolated parotid disease is usually conservative

## Q19-21: Theme: Neck lumps

A.	Dermoid cyst
B.	Thyroglossal cyst
C.	Sjogren's syndrome
D.	Mikulicz's syndrome
E.	Pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid
F.	Carcinoma of the parotid
G.	Cystic hygroma
H.	Branchial cyst
I.	Pharyngeal pouch

Please select the most likely diagnosis for the scenario given. Each option may be used once, more than once or not at all.

### Q19
A dentist treating a women with rheumatoid arthritis for recurrent episodes of dental sepsis notices that both parotid and submandibular glands are symmetrically enlarged.

#### Answer: C. Sjogren's syndrome - TRUE
- Sjogren's is associated with autoimmune disorders
- Mikulicz's is similar but there is no sicca or arthritis

### Q20
A patient presents with a facial nerve palsy. This occurred following repeat excision of a facial lump. The histology report remarks on the biphasic appearance of the lesion and mucinous connective tissue.

#### Answer: E. Pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid - TRUE
- The histological features are as described with a classic biphasic (mixed stromal and epithelial elements)
	- although benign local recurrence can complicate incomplete excision
- As this is a benign lesion direct extension into facial nerve is unlikely to occur
- Facial nerve injury can happen during repeat parotid surgery

### Q21
A patient is recovering from a Sistrunk's procedure, what lesion was treated with this operation? 

#### Answer: B. Thyroglossal cyst - TRUE
- This is the procedure for excision of the cyst and its associated track
- Excision must be complete
	- thus a small segment of the hyoid bone is removed to gain access to the upper part of the cyst tract

## Q22
A 10 year old girl presents with epistaxis. From which of the following regions is the bleeding most likely to originate?

	A. Posterior nasal space
	B. Alar rim
	C. Kisselbach's plexus
	D. Cribriform plate
	E. None of the above

#### Answer: E.	None of the above - *FALSE* = C. Kisselbach's plexus - TRUE
Kisselbachs plexus has an arterial supply derived from both the internal and external carotid arteries and is the commonest area for bleeding in idiopathic epistaxis.

### Epistaxis
- Usually trivial and insignificant but severe haemorrhage may compromise airway and pose a risk to life

#### Anatomy

##### Arterial supply
- From internal and external carotid
- An arterial plexus exists at Little's area and is the source of bleeding in 90% cases
- Major arterial supply is from the sphenopalatine and greater palatine arteries (branches of the maxillary artery)
- The facial artery supplies the more anterior aspect of the nose
- Ethmoidal arteries are branches of the ophthalmic artery
	- They supply the posterosuperior nasal cavity

##### Venous Drainage 
- Follows the arterial pattern

#### Classification
- Primary idiopathic epistaxis accounts for 75% of all cases
- Secondary cases arise as a result of events such as anticoagulants, trauma and coagulopathy
- Classification into anterior and posterior epistaxis may help to locate the source 
	- Becomes more important when invasive treatment is required

#### Management
- Resuscitate if required
- Subject should sit upright and pinch nose firmly
- Nasal cavity should be examined using a headlight
- Simple anterior epistaxis may be managed using silver nitrate cautery. If difficult to manage then custom manufactured packs may be inserted
- Posterior packing or tamponade may be achieved by passing a balloon tamponade device and inflating it. This is indicated where anterior packing along has failed to achieve haemostasis.
- Post nasal pack patients should receive antibiotics
- Failure of these methods will require more invasive therapy.
 	- Where a vascular radiology suite is available consideration may be given to angiographic techniques. Direct ligation of the nasal arterial supply may also be undertaken. Of the arterial ligation techniques available the endo nasal sphenopalatine arterial ligation procedure is most popular.


## Q23
A 56 year old man presents with a painless swelling in the upper part of the anterior triangle of his neck. On examination a mass lesion involving the sub mandibular gland is identified. On CT scanning this is shown to be a solid lesion. There is no regional lymphadenopathy. Two fine needle aspirates have failed to be diagnostic. 

Which of the following is the most appropriate management option?

	A. Sub mandibular gland excision
	B. Incisional biopsy of the mass
	C. Manage conservatively and repeat the CT scan in 6 months
	D. Sub mandibular gland excision and radical neck dissection
	E. Diagnostic excision of the superficial lobe of the submandibular gland

#### Answer: B. Incisional biopsy of the mass - *FALSE* = A. Sub mandibular gland excision - TRUE
- There is a 50% risk that this lesion is malignant (in some series up to 70%). 
- Therefore the gland should be excised entirely
	- At this stage a radical neck dissection is not justified. 

### Submandibular glands- disease

#### Physiology
The submandibular glands secrete approximately 800- 1000ml saliva per day. They typically produce mixed seromucinous secretions. When parasympathetic activity is dominant; the secretions will be more serous. The parasympathetic fibres are derived from the chorda tympani nerves and the submandibular ganglion. Sensory fibres are conveyed by the lingual branch of the mandibular nerve.

#### Sialolithiasis
80% of all salivary gland calculi occur in the submandibular gland
70% of the these calculi are radio-opaque
Stones are usually composed of calcium phosphate or calcium carbonate
Patients typically develop colicky pain and post prandial swelling of the gland
Investigation involves sialography to demonstrate the site of obstruction and associated other stones
Stones impacted in the distal aspect of Whartons duct may be removed orally, other stones and chronic inflammation will usually require gland excision

#### Sialadenitis
Usually occurs as a result of Staphylococcus aureus infection
Pus may be seen leaking from the duct, erythema may also be noted
Development of a sub mandibular abscess is a serious complication as it may spread through the other deep fascial spaces and occlude the airway

#### Submandibular tumours
Only 8% of salivary gland tumours affect the sub mandibular gland
Of these 50% are malignant (usually adenoid cystic carcinoma)
Diagnosis usually involves fine needle aspiration cytology
Imaging is with CT and MRI
In view of the high prevalence of malignancy, all masses of the submandibular glands should generally be excised.

### Q24
A 36-year-old woman who presented with a goitre is diagnosed with autoimmune thyroiditis. Which one of the following types of thyroid cancer is she predisposed to developing?

	A.	Anaplastic
	B.	Lymphoma
	C.	Medullary
	D.	Follicular
	E.	None of the above

#### Answer: E.	None of the above - *FALSE* = B. Lymphoma - TRUE
- Hashimoto's thyroiditis is associated with thyroid lymphoma

Rarely, a patient with Hashimotos thyroiditis may develop a lymphoma of the thyroid gland. The exact aetiology of thyroid gland lymphoma is unknown. Hashimotos thyroiditis is a definite risk factor. It is possible that the lymphoma may represent the expansion of a clone of immortalised intrathyroidal lymphocytes. Lymphoma of the gland is characterised by rapid thyroid growth despite T4 therapy. Whilst adenocarcinoma of the thyroid may occur in association with thyroiditis there are no studies, to date, showing a correlation between these two conditions. The commonest sequelae of thyroiditis is hypothyroidism.

### Thyroiditis

#### Sub acute thyroiditis
Subacute thyroiditis (also known as De Quervain's thyroiditis) is thought to occur following viral infection and typically presents with hyperthyroidism

##### Features
Hyperthyroidism
Painful goitre
Raised ESR
Globally reduced uptake on iodine-131 scan

##### Management
Usually self-limiting - most patients do not require treatment
Thyroid pain may respond to aspirin or other NSAIDs
In more severe cases steroids are used, particularly if hypothyroidism develops

#### Hashimotos thyroiditis
Hashimotos thyroiditis is an immunological disorder in which lymphocytes become sensitised to thyroidal antigens. The three most important antibodies include; thyroglobulin, TPO and TSH-R. During the early phase of Hashimotos the the thyroglobulin antibody is markedly elevated and then declines. 

##### Features
Goitre and either euthyroid or mild hypothyroidism
Progressive hypothyroidism (and associated symptoms)

##### Management
During the hyperthyroid phase of illness beta blockers may manage symptoms
As hypothyroidism develops patients may require thyroxine

## Q25
An elderly diabetic male presents with a severe deep seated otalgia and a facial nerve palsy, he has completed a course of amoxycillin with no benefit. What is the most likely diagnosis?

	A. Malignant otitis externa
	B. Otosclerosis
	C. Acoustic neuroma
	D. Meniers disease
	E. Viral illness

#### Answer: E. Viral illness - *FALSE* = A. Malignant otitis externa = TRUE

A combination of severe otalgia and facial nerve palsy in a diabetic should raise suspicion of malignant otitis externa. This is a condition caused by pseudomonas. It commences as otitis externa and then progresses to involve the temporal bone. Spread of the disease outside the external auditory canal occurs through the fissures of Santorini and the osseocartilaginous junction. 

### Disorders affecting the ear

#### Otitis externa

Variant	| Cause	| Features	|	Treatment	|
Acute otitis externa | Boil in external auditory meatus	| Acute pain on moving the pinna
					|									| Conductive hearing loss if lesion is large
					|									| When rupture occurs pus will flow from ear	Ear packs may be used
Topical antibiotics
Operative debridement may be needed in severe cases

Chronic otitis externa	Chronic combined infection in the external auditory meatus usually combined staphylococcal and fungal infection	Chronic discharge from affected ear, hearing loss and severe pain rare	Cleansing of the external ear and treatment with antifungal and antibacterial ear drops

Otitis media
Variant	Cause	Features	Treatment
Acute suppurative otitis media	Viral induced middle ear effusions secondary to eustacian tube dysfunction	Most common in children and rare in adults
May present with symptoms elsewhere (e.g. vomiting) in children
Severe pain and sometimes fever
May present with discharge is tympanic rupture occurs	Antibiotics (usually amoxycillin)
Chronic suppurative otitis media	May occur with or without cholesteatoma 
Those without cholesteatoma have a perforation of the pars tensa 
Those with cholesteatoma have a perforation of the pars flaccida	Those without cholesteatoma may complain of intermittent discharge (non offensive)
Those with cholesteatoma have impaired hearing and foul smelling discharge	Simple pars tensa perforations may be managed non operatively or a myringoplasty considered if symptoms troublesome.
Pars flaccida perforations will usually require a radical mastoidectomy

#### Otosclerosis
- Progressive conductive deafness
- Secondary to fixation of the stapes in the oval window
- Treatment is with stapedectomy and insertion of a prosthesis

#### Acoustic Neuroma
- Symptoms of gradually progressive unilateral perceptive deafness and tinnitus
- Involvement of the vestibular nerve may cause vertigo
- Extension to involve the facial nerve may cause weakness and then paralysis.

#### Pre-Auricular Sinus
- Common congenital condition in which an epithelial defect forms around the external ear
- Small sinuses require no treatment
- Deeper sinuses may become blocked and develop episodes of infection, they may be closely related to the facial nerve and are challenging to excise

## Q26
Which of the following does not cause parotid enlargement?

	A.	Liver cirrhosis
	B.	Myxoedema
	C.	Amiodarone
	D.	Tuberculosis
	E.	Sjogrens syndrome

#### Answer: C. Amiodarone - TRUE
Drugs commonly implicated in parotid gland enlargement include: 
	- Thiouracil
	- Isoprenaline
	- Phenylbutazone
	- high oestrogen dose contraceptive pills (OCP)

## Q27
At which of the following time frames is _secondary haemorrhage_ most likely to occur following tonsillectomy?

	A.	Between 5 and 10 days after surgery
	B.	During the first 6 hours after surgery
	C.	Between 6 and 12 hours after surgery
	D.	Upon resumption of normal feeding
	E.	Between 2 and 3 days post operatively

#### Answer: E.	Between 2 and 3 days post operatively - *FALSE* = A.	Between 5 and 10 days after surgery - TRUE
- Haemorrhage in the first 6 hours after surgery is termed reactionary haemorrhage
- Feeding does not increase the risk and may actually lower the risks of infection developing

### Secondary haemorrhage after tonsillectomy
- Haemorrhage is a **feared complication** following tonsillectomy
- Primary, or reactionary haemorrhage most commonly occurs in the first 6-8 hours following surgery
	- It is managed by immediate return to theatre
- Secondary haemorrhage occurs between 5 and 10 days after surgery
	- It is often associated with a wound infection
	- Treatment is usually with admission and antibiotics
	- Severe bleeding may require surgery
	- Secondary haemorrhage occurs in 3% of all tonsillectomies

## Q28
A 8 year old boy with recurrent attacks of otitis media is suspected of developing a glue ear. If his sound conduction is tested, which of the following is most consistent with a unilateral middle ear effusion?

	A. Negative Rinne's test on the ipsilateral side
	B. Positive Rinne's test on the ipsilateral side
	C. Positive Webers and Rinnes tests on the ipsilateral side
	D. Positive Rinne's test on the contralateral side
	E. Negative Webers test only on the contralateral side

### Answer: B. Positive Rinne's test on the ipsilateral side - *FALSE* = A. Negative Rinne's test on the ipsilateral side - TRUE
- *Theme from 2008 Exam*
- Rinne's test will localise to the affected side (i.e. it is negative in conductive deafness)
- In a positive Rinne's test sound heard by air conduction is better than that conveyed by bone conduction
- Reduction of both air and bone conduction in equal measure is a feature of sensorineural hearing loss

### Hearing Loss

Hearing loss may be conductive or sensorineural. To determine which is present patients will often require a formal assessment with pure tone audiometry. In the clinical setting Webers and Rinnes tests may be helpful in categorising various types of hearing loss.

#### Webers and Rinnes Tests
In a normal patient, the Weber tuning fork sound is heard equally loud in both ears with no one ear hearing the sound louder than the other. A patient with symmetrical hearing loss will hear the Weber tuning fork sound equally well with diagnostic utility only in asymmetric (one-sided) hearing losses. In a patient with asymmetrical hearing loss, the Weber tuning fork sound is heard louder in one ear versus the other. This clinical finding should be confirmed by repeating the procedure and having the patient occlude one ear with a finger; the sound should be heard best in the occluded ear.

Rinne Test	| Weber without lateralisation	| Weber lateralises to left	| Weber lateralises to right | 
---|---|---|---|
Both ears Air > Bone 	| Normal	| Sensorineural loss on right	| Sensorineural 	loss on left
Left Bone > Air			|			| Conductive loss on left		| Combined loss on 	left
Right Bone > Air		|			| Combined loss on right		| Conductive loss 	on right	
Both Bone > Air			|			| Combined loss on right and conductive on left	| 	Combined loss on left and conductive on right

### Q29
The parents of a 2 year old child are concerned after he develops a lump in his neck. On examination there is a swelling in the subcutaneous tissue of the posterior triangle which transilluminates. (*Similar theme question in September 2011 exam*).

#### Answer: G. Cystic hygroma - TRUE
- This is a classical description
	- Collection of dilated lymphatic sacs which are fluctuant and brilliantly transilluminable
- Recurrence is common

### Q30
A 40 year old female presents with a painless neck lump. There is a mass noted beneath the sternocleidomastoid muscle. There is a long history and somewhat unkindly her husband remarked on her rather noticeable halitosis.

#### Answer: I. Pharyngeal pouch - TRUE
- Usual history of regurgitation of undigested food or coughing at night
- Associated with *halitosis* and *throat infections*

### Q31
A 32 year old lady is referred to the clinic with recurrent infections and abscesses in the neck. On examination she has a midline defect with an overlying scab, which moves upwards on tongue protrusion.

#### Answer: B. Thyroglossal cyst - TRUE
- Thyroglossal cyst is always located in the midline
	- It is this route that the thyroid takes during its embryological descent
- Its connection with the foramen caecum means it will move on tongue protrusion

---

## Neck Lumps
- The table below gives characteristic exam question features for conditions causing neck lumps:

Condition 					| Description	|
----------------------------|---------------|
Reactive lymphadenopathy	| By far the most common cause of neck swellings. There may be a history of local infection or a generalised viral illness
Lymphoma					| Rubbery, painless lymphadenopathy
							| The phenomenon of pain whilst drinking alcohol is very uncommon
							| There may be associated night sweats and splenomegaly
Thyroid swelling			| May be hypo-, eu- or hyperthyroid symptomatically
							| Moves upwards on swallowing
Thyroglossal cyst			| More common in patients < 20 years old
							| Usually midline, between the isthmus of the thyroid and the hyoid bone
							| Moves upwards with protrusion of the tongue
							| May be painful if infected
Pharyngeal pouch			| More common in older men
							| Represents a posteromedial herniation between thyropharyngeus and cricopharyngeus muscles
							| Usually not seen, but if large then a midline lump in the neck that gurgles on palpation
							| Typical symptoms are dysphagia, regurgitation, aspiration and chronic cough
Cystic hygroma				| A congenital lymphatic lesion (lymphangioma) typically found in the neck, classically on the left side
							| Most are evident at birth, around 90% present before 2 years of age
Branchial cyst				| An oval, mobile cystic mass that develops between the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the pharynx
							| Develop due to failure of obliteration of the second branchial cleft in embryonic development
							| Usually present in early adulthood
Cervical rib				| More common in adult females
							| Around 10% develop thoracic outlet syndrome
Carotid aneurysm			| Pulsatile lateral neck mass which doesn't move on swallowing

## Notes: Parotid Gland Clinical

### Benign neoplasms
- Up to 80% of all salivary gland tumours occur in the parotid gland
	- And up to 80% of these are benign
- There is no consistent correlation between the rate of growth and the malignant potential of the lesion
	- However, benign tumours should not invade structures such as the facial nerve
- With the exception of Warthins tumours, they are commoner in women than men
- The median age of developing a lesion is in the 5th decade of life (40s)

### Benign tumour types
Tumour type	| Features | 
Benign pleomorphic adenoma or benign mixed tumor	Most common parotid neoplasm (80%) 
Proliferation of epithelial and myoepithelial cells of the ducts and an increase in stromal components
Slow growing, lobular, and not well encapsulated
Recurrence rate of 1-5% with appropriate excision (parotidectomy)
Recurrence possibly secondary to capsular disruption during surgery
Malignant degeneration occurring in 2-10% of adenomas observed for long periods, with carcinoma ex-pleomorphic adenoma occurring most frequently as adenocarcinoma
Warthin tumor (papillary cystadenoma lymphoma or adenolymphoma	Second most common benign parotid tumor (5%)
Most common bilateral benign neoplasm of the parotid
Marked male as compared to female predominance
Occurs later in life (sixth and seventh decades)
Presents as a lymphocytic infiltrate and cystic epithelial proliferation
May represent heterotopic salivary gland epithelial tissue trapped within intraparotid lymph nodes
Incidence of bilaterality and multicentricity of 10%
Malignant transformation rare (almost unheard of)
Monomorphic adenoma	Account for less than 5% of tumours
Slow growing
Consist of only one morphological cell type (hence term mono)
Include; basal cell adenoma, canalicular adenoma, oncocytoma, myoepitheliomas
Haemangioma	Should be considered in the differential of a parotid mass in a child
Accounts for 90% of parotid tumours in children less than 1 year of age
Hypervascular on imaging
Spontaneous regression may occur and malignant transformation is almost unheard of

### Malignant salivary gland tumours

#### Types of malignancy

Mucoepidermoid carcinoma	30% of all parotid malignancies
Usually low potential for local invasiveness and metastasis (depends mainly on grade)
Adenoid cystic carcinoma	Unpredictable growth pattern
Tendency for perineural spread
Nerve growth may display skip lesions resulting in incomplete excision
Distant metastasis more common (visceral rather than nodal spread)
5 year survival 35%
Mixed tumours	Often a malignancy occurring in a previously benign parotid lesion
Acinic cell carcinoma	Intermediate grade malignancy
May show perineural invasion
Low potential for distant metastasis
5 year survival 80%
Adenocarcinoma	Develops from secretory portion of gland
Risk of regional nodal and distant metastasis
5 year survival depends upon stage at presentation, may be up to 75% with small lesions with no nodal involvement
Lymphoma	Large rubbery lesion, may occur in association with Warthins tumours
Diagnosis should be based on regional nodal biopsy rather than parotid resection
Treatment is with chemotherapy (and radiotherapy)

#### Diagnostic evaluation
Plain x-rays may be used to exclude calculi
Sialography may be used to delineate ductal anatomy
FNAC is used in most cases
Superficial parotidectomy may be either diagnostic of therapeutic depending upon the nature of the lesion
Where malignancy is suspected the primary approach should be definitive resection rather than excisional biopsy
CT/ MRI may be used in cases of malignancy for staging primary disease

#### Treatment
- For nearly all lesions this consists of surgical resection
	- For benign disease this will usually consist of a superficial parotidectomy
- For malignant disease a radical or extended radical parotidectomy is performed
	- The facial nerve is included in the resection if involved
- Need for neck dissection is determined by the potential for nodal involvement

### Other parotid disorders

#### HIV infection
- Lymphoepithelial cysts associated with HIV occur almost exclusively in the parotid
- Typically presents as bilateral, multicystic, symmetrical swelling
- Risk of malignant transformation is low and management usually conservative

#### Sjogren syndrome
- Autoimmune disorder characterised by
	1. parotid enlargement
	2. xerostomia, 
	3. keratoconjunctivitis sicca
- 90% of cases occur in females
- Second most common connective tissue disorder
- Bilateral, non tender enlargement of the gland is usual
- Histologically, the usual findings are of 
	- A lymphocytic infiltrate in acinar units and 
	- Epimyoepithelial islands surrounded by lymphoid stroma
- Treatment is supportive
- There is an increased risk of subsequent lymphoma

#### Sarcoid
- Parotid involvement occurs in 6% of patients with sarcoid
- Bilateral in most cases
- Gland is **not** tender
- Xerostomia may occur
- Management of isolated parotid disease is usually conservative
