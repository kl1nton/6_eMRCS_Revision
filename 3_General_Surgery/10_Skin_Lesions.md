eMRCS: General Surgery: 10 Skin Lesions
=======================================

## T1: Theme: Skin disease

A.	Squamous cell carcinoma
B.	Bowens disease
C.	Actinic keratosis
D.	Basal cell carcinoma
E.	Malignant melanoma
F.	Keratoacanthoma
G.	Apthous ulcer
H.	Pyogenic granuloma

Please select the most likely underlying diagnosis for each of the following skin lesions. Each option may be used once, more than once or not at all.

### Q1
A 53 year old man presents with a nodule on his chin. He is concerned because it has grown extremely rapidly over the course of the preceding week. On examination he has a swollen, red, dome shaped lesion with a central defect that contains a keratinous type material. 

#### Answer: F. Keratoacanthoma - TRUE
- _Theme from April 2013 Exam_
- Keratoacanthomas are characterised by a rapid growth phase. This may mimic amelanotic melanoma (although such rapid growth is rare even in these lesions). The keratin core is the clue as to the true nature of the lesion.

### Q2
A 68 year old farmer presents with a skin lesion on his forehead. It has been present for the past 6 months and has grown slightly in size during that time. On examination he has an ulcerated lesion with pearly white raised edges that measures 2cm in diameter.

#### Answer: D. Basal cell carcinoma - TRUE
- The raised pearly edges in an ulcerated lesion at a sun exposed site makes BCC most likely.

### Q3
A 34 year old gardener presents with a lesion affecting the dorsum of his right hand. It has been present for the past 10 days and occurred after he had been pruning rose bushes. On examination he has a raised ulcerated lesion which bleeds easily on contact.

#### Answer: G. Apthous ulcer - *FALSE* = H. Pyogenic granuloma - TRUE
- Trauma is a common precipitant of pyogenic granuloma and contact bleeding and ulceration are common.

## T2

Theme: Skin disorders

A.	Basal cell carcinoma
B.	Dermatofibroma
C.	Pilar cyst
D.	Epidermoid cyst
E.	Spitz naevus
F.	Seborrhoeic keratosis
G.	Atypical naevus
H.	Capillary cavernous haemangioma

Please select the most likely underlying nature of the skin lesion described. Each option may be used once, more than once or not at all.

### Q4
A 70 year old lady presents with a number of skin lesions that she describes as unsightly. On examination she has a number of raised lesions with a greasy surface located over her trunk. Apart from having a greasy surface the lesions also seem to have scattered keratin plugs located within them.

#### Answer: B. Dermatofibroma - *FALSE* = F. Sehorrhoeic keratosis - TRUE
- _Theme from September 2012 Exami_
- Seborrhoeic keratosis may have a number of appearances. However, the scaly, thick, greasy surface with scattered keratin plugs makes this the most likely diagnosis.

### Q5
A 28 year old female presents with a small nodule located on the back of her neck. It is excised for cosmetic reasons and the histology report states that the lesion consists of a sebum filled lesion surrounded by the outer root sheath of a hair follicle.

#### Answer: C. Pilar cyst - TRUE
- Pilar cysts may contain foul smelling cheesy material and are surrounded by the outer part of a hair follicle. Because of their histological appearances they are more correctly termed pilar cysts than sebaceous cysts.

### Q6
A 21 year old lady presents with a nodule on the posterior aspect of her right calf. It has been present at the site for the past 6 months and occurred at the site of a previous insect bite. Although the nodule appears small, on palpation it appears to be nearly twice the size it appears on examination. The overlying skin is faintly pigmented.

#### Answer: Capillary cavernous haemangioma - *FALSE* = B. Dermatofibroma - TRUE
- Dermatofibromas may be pigmented and are often larger than they appear. They frequently occur at sites of previous trauma.

### Benign skin diseases

#### Seborrhoeic keratosis
- Most commonly arise in patients over the age of 50 years, often idiopathic
- Equal sex incidence and prevalence
- Usually multiple lesions over face and trunk
- Flat, raised, filiform and pedunculated subtypes are recognised
- Variable colours and surface may have greasy scale overlying it
- Treatment options consist of leaving alone or simple shave excision

#### Melanocytic naevi

##### Congenital melanocytic naevi	
- Typically appear at, or soon after, birth
- Usually greater than 1cm diameter
- Increased risk of malignant transformation (increased risk greatest for large lesions)

##### Junctional melanocytic naevi	
- Circular macules
- May have heterogeneous colour even within same lesion
- Most naevi of the palms, soles and mucous membranes are of this type

##### Compound naevi	
- Domed pigmented nodules up to 1cm in diameter
- Arise from junctional naevi, usually have uniform colour and are smooth

##### Spitz naevus	
- Usually develop over a few months in children
- May be pink or red in colour, most common on face and legs
- May grow up to 1cm and growth can be rapid, this usually results in excision

##### Atypical naevus syndrome	
- Atypical melanocytic naevi that may be autosomally dominantly inherited
- Some individuals are at increased risk of melanoma (usually have mutations of CDKN2A gene)
- Many people with atypical naevus syndrome AND a parent sibling with melanoma will develop melanoma

#### Epidermoid cysts
- Common and affect face and trunk
- They have a central punctum, they may contain small quantities of sebum
- The cyst lining is either normal epidermis (epidermoid cyst) or outer root sheath of hair follicle (pilar cyst)

#### Dermatofibroma
- Solitary dermal nodules
- Usually affect extremities of young adults
- Lesions feel larger than they appear visually
- Histologically they consist of proliferating fibroblasts merging with sparsely cellular dermal tissues

#### Painful skin lesions
- Eccrine spiradenoma
- Neuroma
- Glomus tumour
- Leimyoma
- Angiolipoma
- Neurofibroma (rarely painful) and dermatofibroma (rarely painful)
