=======================================

## T1: Theme: Skin disease

A.	Squamous cell carcinoma
B.	Bowens disease
C.	Actinic keratosis
D.	Basal cell carcinoma
E.	Malignant melanoma
F.	Keratoacanthoma
G.	Apthous ulcer
H.	Pyogenic granuloma

Please select the most likely underlying diagnosis for each of the following skin lesions. Each option may be used once, more than once or not at all.

### Q1
A 53 year old man presents with a nodule on his chin. He is concerned because it has grown extremely rapidly over the course of the preceding week. On examination he has a swollen, red, dome shaped lesion with a central defect that contains a keratinous type material. 

#### Answer: F. Keratoacanthoma - TRUE
- _Theme from April 2013 Exam_
- Keratoacanthomas are characterised by a rapid growth phase. This may mimic amelanotic melanoma (although such rapid growth is rare even in these lesions). The keratin core is the clue as to the true nature of the lesion.

### Q2
A 68 year old farmer presents with a skin lesion on his forehead. It has been present for the past 6 months and has grown slightly in size during that time. On examination he has an ulcerated lesion with pearly white raised edges that measures 2cm in diameter.

#### Answer: D. Basal cell carcinoma - TRUE
- The raised pearly edges in an ulcerated lesion at a sun exposed site makes BCC most likely.

### Q3
A 34 year old gardener presents with a lesion affecting the dorsum of his right hand. It has been present for the past 10 days and occurred after he had been pruning rose bushes. On examination he has a raised ulcerated lesion which bleeds easily on contact.

#### Answer: G. Apthous ulcer - *FALSE* = H. Pyogenic granuloma - TRUE
- Trauma is a common precipitant of pyogenic granuloma and contact bleeding and ulceration are common.

## T2

Theme: Skin disorders

A.	Basal cell carcinoma
B.	Dermatofibroma
C.	Pilar cyst
D.	Epidermoid cyst
E.	Spitz naevus
F.	Seborrhoeic keratosis
G.	Atypical naevus
H.	Capillary cavernous haemangioma

Please select the most likely underlying nature of the skin lesion described. Each option may be used once, more than once or not at all.

### Q4
A 70 year old lady presents with a number of skin lesions that she describes as unsightly. On examination she has a number of raised lesions with a greasy surface located over her trunk. Apart from having a greasy surface the lesions also seem to have scattered keratin plugs located within them.

#### Answer: B. Dermatofibroma - *FALSE* = F. Sehorrhoeic keratosis - TRUE
- _Theme from September 2012 Exami_
- Seborrhoeic keratosis may have a number of appearances. However, the scaly, thick, greasy surface with scattered keratin plugs makes this the most likely diagnosis.

### Q5
A 28 year old female presents with a small nodule located on the back of her neck. It is excised for cosmetic reasons and the histology report states that the lesion consists of a sebum filled lesion surrounded by the outer root sheath of a hair follicle.

#### Answer: C. Pilar cyst - TRUE
- Pilar cysts may contain foul smelling cheesy material and are surrounded by the outer part of a hair follicle. Because of their histological appearances they are more correctly termed pilar cysts than sebaceous cysts.

### Q6
A 21 year old lady presents with a nodule on the posterior aspect of her right calf. It has been present at the site for the past 6 months and occurred at the site of a previous insect bite. Although the nodule appears small, on palpation it appears to be nearly twice the size it appears on examination. The overlying skin is faintly pigmented.

#### Answer: Capillary cavernous haemangioma - *FALSE* = B. Dermatofibroma - TRUE
- Dermatofibromas may be pigmented and are often larger than they appear. They frequently occur at sites of previous trauma.
