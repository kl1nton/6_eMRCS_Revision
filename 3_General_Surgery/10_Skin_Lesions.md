E.	Malignant melanoma
F.	Keratoacanthoma
G.	Apthous ulcer
H.	Pyogenic granuloma

Please select the most likely underlying diagnosis for each of the following skin lesions. Each option may be used once, more than once or not at all.

### Q1
A 53 year old man presents with a nodule on his chin. He is concerned because it has grown extremely rapidly over the course of the preceding week. On examination he has a swollen, red, dome shaped lesion with a central defect that contains a keratinous type material. 

#### Answer: F. Keratoacanthoma - TRUE
- _Theme from April 2013 Exam_
- Keratoacanthomas are characterised by a rapid growth phase. This may mimic amelanotic melanoma (although such rapid growth is rare even in these lesions). The keratin core is the clue as to the true nature of the lesion.

### Q2
A 68 year old farmer presents with a skin lesion on his forehead. It has been present for the past 6 months and has grown slightly in size during that time. On examination he has an ulcerated lesion with pearly white raised edges that measures 2cm in diameter.

#### Answer: D. Basal cell carcinoma - TRUE
- The raised pearly edges in an ulcerated lesion at a sun exposed site makes BCC most likely.

### Q3
A 34 year old gardener presents with a lesion affecting the dorsum of his right hand. It has been present for the past 10 days and occurred after he had been pruning rose bushes. On examination he has a raised ulcerated lesion which bleeds easily on contact.

#### Answer: G. Apthous ulcer - *FALSE* = H. Pyogenic granuloma - TRUE
- Trauma is a common precipitant of pyogenic granuloma and contact bleeding and ulceration are common.
