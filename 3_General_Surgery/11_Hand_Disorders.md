### Q1
A 49 -year-old male presents with discomfort in the fingers of his left hand. On examination the ring and little fingers of his left hand are flexed and unable to extend completely. He is able to make a fist with the hand. Palpation reveals thickened nodules on the medial half of the palm.

#### Answer: B.	Dupuytren's contracture - TRUE
- Discomfort of the hand is not uncommon in Dupuytrens contracture, true pain is unusual
- The disease most commonly affects the ring and little fingers

### Q2
A 62 year old man presents after his wife commented on the unusual shape of his fingers. On examination he has a hard swelling adjacent to the distal interphalangeal joint of his index finger of the right hand with lateral deviation of the finger tip. There is no sensory disturbance and the swelling is not tender.

#### Answer: I. Tendon sheath infection - *FALSE*
These are bony outgrowths that occur in the distal interphalangeal joint in association with osteoarthritis. They may skew the finger tip sideways. Bouchards nodes are similar, but affect the proximal interphalangeal joint.

## Q3
A 57 year - old lady presents with a three month history of pins and needles in the fingers of the right hand, particularly at night. On examination, there is some loss of the sensation over the palmar aspect of the lateral three fingers and wasting of the thenar eminence.

#### Answer: E. Carpal tunnel syndrome - TRUE
Carpal tunnel syndrome commonly produces pain at night as the wrists are flexed during sleep. Compromise of the median nerve may produce wasting of the thenar eminence muscles.
